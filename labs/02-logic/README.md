### Learning objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:

* Use truth table, K-map, SoP/PoS forms of logic functions
* Minimize logic function
* Understand signal assignments in VHDL
* Use VHDL assertion statements for testing

The purpose of this laboratory exercise is to learn to use different ways of writing combination functions (truth table, K-map, SoP/PoS forms), their minimization, the use of signal assignments in VHDL, and assertion statements in VHDL testbench.

## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

*Digital* or *Binary comparator* compares the digital signals A, B presented at input terminal and produce outputs depending upon the condition of those inputs.

1. Complete the truth table for 2-bit *Identity comparator* (B equals A), and two *Magnitude comparators* (B is greater than A, B is less than A). Note that, such a digital device has four inputs and three outputs/functions.

   | **Dec. equivalent** | **B[1:0]** | **A[1:0]** | **B is greater than A** | **B equals A** | **B is less than A** |
